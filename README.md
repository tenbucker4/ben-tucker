My latest iteration of my personal portfolio showcasing my latest projects, some information about myself and contact information. This site is built with React and custom CSS. I took some extra time to focus on the user experience of browsing the site on all device sizes. Scroll snapping was used in the CSS to allow for smooth transitions between page heights. I also took some time to improve the reusability and scalability of the React components to allow for changes in the future.
